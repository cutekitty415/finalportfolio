                            The design of a business's webpage can have an enormous influence on how successful it can be. In this assignment, I underwent the workflow of the entire process of redesigning a simple home page for the website of a small restaurant. I learned to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface, created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, and built a responsive website based on those prototypes.                        </p>

                            I chose to redesign the home page for a local vegan restaurant in my hometown: Garden Fresh. This is one of my family’s favorite restaurants to visit, yet its website seems a bit outdated and has a lot of room for potential improvement. There are three main elements to the homepage: link to order, photo gallery, and restaurant information.                        </p>
                        <p class="about__text">
                            You can access the home page of the restaurant <a class="project_contentlink" href="https://www.gardenfreshpaloalto.com/home">here</a>.   
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-text">
                            I used WebAIM WAVE to detect possible accessibility problems, which detected no errors with the web page with 4 potential alerts. One alert included the issue with redundant ordering buttons that I had described earlier. Manual testing is still necessary to ensure accessibility for the user. Specifically, if there are no navigation buttons, menu link, affordances, and icons existing on the website in the first place, WebAIM WAVE would have a hard time finding an error with these missing elements.

                        </h3>
                                Next, I manually analyzed the home page of Garden Fresh based on usability and accessibility standards.
                            <div class="project_content3 bd-grid">
                                <div class="about__text">
                                    <h3>Efficiency</h3>
                                    <li class="project_contentlist">Incorrect navigation buttons</li>
                                    <p>
                                        Clicking on the restaurant’s logo takes you to the shopping cart page page. There are also two duplicate buttons that take users to the ordering page: “Order Online” and “Click Here”.
                                    </p>
                                    <li class="project_contentlist">Lack of navigation to critical elements</li>
                                    <p>
                                        There is no menu button, which is essential for the web page of a restaurant business. According to OpenTable, 93% of people look at a restaurant’s menu online before dining out.
                                    </p>
                                    <li class="project_contentlist">There are no clear buttons for calling the restaurant</li>
                                    <p>
                                        The text for the restaurant’s phone number is very small, and since the phone number is the only form of contact information listed on the website, it should be in clear view so that potential customers can call the restaurant with questions and orders.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="about__text">
                                    <h3>Learnability</h3>
                                    <li class="project_contentlist">Confusing color scheme</li>
                                    <p>
                                        Dark orange is used in both “Order Now” subheading and “Order Now” button. This adds to user confusion because the heading is too similar to button colors.
                                    </p>
                                    <li class="project_contentlist">Lack of affordances and icons </li>
                                    <p>
                                        ‍The "Click Here” button can benefit from adding arrow sign. The“Food types” section uses the same check mark icons for all of the different food types, but can better visually communicate the different cuisines by using different food icons.
                                    </p>
                                    <li class="project_contentlist">Images of the restaurant’s dishes are organized very messily </li>
                                    <p>
                                        The messy organization of the restaurant's food pictures can be unappealing and put off the appetite of potential customers
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>
                                        When landing on the page, a high-quality image of a signature dish can increase users’ memorability of the cuisine. Rather, not having an image of what type of food the restaurant serves can put off potential customers.
                                    </p>
                                    <li class="project_contentlist">Website not optimized for mobile devices </li>

                                        ‍Users have to vertically scroll through all of the individual food pictures before reaching restaurant information section. This is extremely difficult to do, since there are so many food pictures. The organization of the website on mobile devices is not very logical, since the most important parts of the website such as contact information and hours are placed at the very end.

                        Here is the link to the redesigned website incorporating the elements that I created above: <a href="https://cutekitty415.github.io/assign0/" class="project_contentlink">Redesigned Website</a>.                         The new website is built with HTML and CSS, and fully responsive with some buttons or navigational elements being replaced with dummy elements.
                        Through this project, I learned a lot about usability and accessibility standards. I discovered that websites need to be responsive on many different types of devices, and that a good design needs to be flexible enough to support those different formats. An interesting lesson I learned was that implementing a scrolling photo gallery was no more difficult than implementing a grid-style photo gallery.
