                            In fast-food and casual restaurants, it's more common than ever to see a self-order kiosk as soon as you walk in the door. In this project, I observed real users interacting with a self-order kiosk at Tiger Sugar, a boba shop on Thayer Street. I interviewed these individuals about their experiences, crafted personas based on their responses, and sketched a storyboard mapping out the user experience.

                            The self-ordering kiosk at Tiger Sugar is a small system consisting mainly of a touchscreen with a payment scanner. The figure on the left is the touchscreen, which includes Tiger Sugar's menu and guides customers through the ordering process – from customizing their drinks, payment, reward points, and pickup.

                            The key problem this interface is trying to solve is allowing customers to make their own orders at Tiger Sugar to increase the efficiency of the ordering process.
                            I observed three users using the self-ordering interface, and recorded some key observations about their interactions with the interface.

                                        User A’s interactions with the self-ordering interface were very rushed.

                                        User B spent the longest amount of time interacting with the interface. The majority of the time was spent choosing a drink and customizing toppings. This user went back and forth between the menu screen and individual drink screens, and frequently changed the drink selections and customization options in the cart.

                                        User C came into the store with another person and ordered for both of them. User C asked the other person for which order they would like, and customized their drink selection accordingly. However, when checking out, the other person noticed that User C made a mistake in their order and made User C go back to change the drink customization.

        Through this project, I learned a lot about how to approach designing personas for a particular interface. I discovered that users of self-ordering kiosks faced the challenge of tipping even without the pressure of having a physical employee watching them. An interesting lesson I learned was that observing people in public can be much more difficult in practice because it is hard not to interact with the person you are observing. Some immediate next steps include prototyping alterate designs for the self-ordering kiosk interface based upon the research gathered in this project.
